Kallocain before compressing contains 318 997 characters which will correspond to 2 551 976 bits, (one byte each)
After compressing it the sequence contains 1 428 800 bits which gives means that the compressed text is only around 
half the size of the original (56%).

TC:
n to create the encoding table where n is the length of the string.
It takes log(n) to find the translation of a character, and since there
needs to be done n translations (each character) the complexity will be
n*log(n). Which gives n + n*log(n).
The time complexity for Huffman encoding and decoding will belong to O(n*log(n)
